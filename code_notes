#Hey guys, I figure we can use this file for keeping notes on what we've figured out so far
#so far I created two separate files within ref_sequences that combines hsp70 sequences and mscrAgene sequences. below is the code I used

cat hsp70* > hsp70refs
cat mcrAgene* > mcrAgenerefs

#you should see these two files inside the ref_sequences folder
#next I ran muscle sequence with one of the proteome files against the mcrAgenerefs file

../muscle -in proteomes/proteome_01.fasta -out ref_sequences/mcrAgenerefs 

#this is currently what the code output looks like (not the actual final file but the descriptions while command is running)

2.4 Fastest speed
If you want the fastest possible speed, then the following example shows the applicable options for proteins.

muscle -in seqs.fa -out seqs.afa -maxiters 1 -diags1 -sv -distance1 kbit20_3

#I just realized that my first muscle code is probably wrong. I think the file after -out is just the name of the output file.
#next I tried

../muscle -in proteomes/proteome_01.fasta -out proteomes/proteome_01.afa -maxiters 1 -diags1 -sv -distance1 kbit20_3

#it went faster and this was my output
